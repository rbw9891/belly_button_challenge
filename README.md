# belly_button_challenge

Here in lies the belly button challenge respository for module 14:

## Background

In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the belly button diversity
dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational
taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the
rest were relatively rare.
